code, tests, and documentation in one bundle root.

| `src/observability/collector_core.py` | Pure archive validation and allowlisted normalization |
| `src/observability/collect_dbt_artifacts.py` | Deployed notebook adapter, Jobs discovery, Delta persistence, views, and cleanup |
| `tests/test_collector_core.py` | Collector security, state, idempotency, and schema tests |
| `tests/test_job_resources.py` | Bundle/job contract tests |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Credential-free PR quality, strict docs build, and offline dbt graph validation |

## dbt tree

| Path | Resource |
|------|----------|
| `src/seeds/nyc_taxi/nyc_taxi_trips_seed.csv` | Committed 100-row seed |
| `src/seeds/nyc_taxi/properties.yml` | Seed metadata |
| `src/models/nyc_taxi/nyc_taxi_trips.sql` | Single Delta-table model |
| `src/models/nyc_taxi/schema.yml` | Model descriptions and two `not_null` tests |

See [dbt project](dbt-project.md) for the executable contract.

## Generated and local-only paths

The following are ignored and must not be committed:

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `.databricks/` | Local bundle state and overrides |
| `.databrickscfg` | Local CLI profiles if created inside the repository |
| `.env*`, `*.local.yml`, `*.local.yaml` | Local values and secrets |
| `target/`, `logs/`, `dbt_packages/` | dbt output and packages |
| `.venv/`, Python/tool caches | Local development environment |
| `site/`, `docs/_build/` | Generated documentation |

`~/.databrickscfg` is outside the repository but should still be treated as
credential-bearing local configuration.

## Agent skills

`.agents/skills/` contains copied dbt agent-skill instructions and
`skills-lock.json` records their installation. They are development aids and
are not uploaded as Lakeflow tasks or imported by the collector runtime.
